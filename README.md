# Practice-projects---Frontend

Hey guys, welcome to my mini-projects channel, I'm totally new to Frontend but I really love the 'magic' that it can do to the website...

So I will upload those projects that i've learned, just to keep track my progress.

If you have any suggestion or ideas, just DM me!

哈喽大家好呀，这里是前端新手！在这个文档里我会上传所有我做的一些小项目来记录我的学习历程📒

如果你有好的想法也欢迎一起讨论！
